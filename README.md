  ## Design
  ### Colour Scheme
  The main colours in the website theme for header, background and text are Green, Grey, Black and White
  ### Typography
  I used Bootstrap 4.4.1 for the components and styling. Oswald and sans-serif are the main fonts used.
  ### Images
  Imagery was chosen to go with the website's colour and content theme. I'm using earthy and green images for the Hero image and favicon which are deep-toned, soothing and have attractive graphics. For the products I'm using high resolution images sorced from google.

  ## Wireframes

For those of you not using MFA/2FA: Log in to Heroku and enter your details.
command: heroku login -i
3. Get your app name from heroku.
command: heroku apps
4. Set the heroku remote. (Replace <app_name> with your actual app name and remove the <> characters)
command: heroku git:remote -a <app_name>
5. Add and commit any changes to your code if applicable
command: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"
6. Push to both GitHub and Heroku
command: git push origin main
command: git push heroku main
## MFA/2FA enabled?
1. Click on Account Settings (under the avatar menu) on the Heroku Dashboard.
2. Scroll down to the API Key section and click Reveal. Copy the key.
3. Back in your Gitpod workspace, enter the command: heroku_config , and enter your API key you copied when prompted.
