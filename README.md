  ### Typography
  I used Bootstrap 4.4.1 for the components and styling. Oswald and sans-serif are the main fonts used.
  ### Images
  Imagery was chosen to go with the website's colour and content theme. I'm using earthy and green images for the Hero image and favicon which are deep-toned, soothing and have attractive graphics. For the products I'm using high resolution images sorced from google.

command: heroku git:remote -a <app_name>
5. Add and commit any changes to your code if applicable
command: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"
6. Push to both GitHub and Heroku
command: git push origin main
command: git push heroku main
